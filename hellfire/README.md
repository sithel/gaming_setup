#Hellfire

It's the debate team, meets improve, meets religious fanatics.

## Pre-Game

Everyone plots out a Deity to be a fanatic for. Some pre-game collaboration is require to ensure not too much overlap. Light costuming (easily removed) and props can be planned/constructed.

## Game Space

In theory sitting around a table should work just fine. Idealy there would be some space to wander around in, a small room perhaps. Maybe a second, more secluded space in addition.

## Game Flow

There are `N` players. There should be a minimum of 5, more would be better.

The game is divided into days that are a fixed duration in time (10 minutes?). Each day is a round. The more rounds, the better. There should be a miniumum of `N * 2` rounds.

During a round there are `X` fanatics and `Y` flock, where `X + Y = N`, `X < Y`, and `X >= 2`.

Each day there is a theme or recent event randomly generated. Ex: a home burned down, there was flooding, the crops have been failing, a baby was born disfigured, a comet has been seen in the night sky.

During the day the fanatics preach to the flock. They can shout soapbox style. They can council 1:1. Possibly they can perform feats to aid a member of the flock [see: Bonus Digital Content]

At the end of the day (or througuth) the flock can pray, donate, convert, etc to a Deity. Only Deities they've been preached about are valid.

Once the day is done one fanatic player transitions to a flock player and one flock player is elevated to be a fanatic. This way people are cycled between their "primary" character and an NPC. On every day boundry a flock player can optionally "generate" a new flock character or continue that day's member. When a flock player transitions to their fanatic role their flock character ends. There is no returning to a discarded/ended flock character.

## Goal

Obviously the goal of the game would just be to have fun/play silly roles. But it's also to see who can get the most converts/funds/etc.

## Example Game

Given players: *1 2 3 4 5 6*

| Fanatics | Flock | Round |
| -------- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 2 | 3 4 5 6 |  1|
|2 3 | 4 5 6 1 |  2|
|3 4 | 5 6 1 2 |  3|
|4 5 | 6 1 2 3 |    4|
|5 6 | 1 2 3 4 |  5|
|6 1 | 2 3 4 5 |  6|
|1 3 | 2 4 5 6 |  7|
|3 5 | 1 2 4 6 |  8|
|5 2 | 1 3 4 6 |  9|
|2 6 | 1 3 4 5 |  10|
|6 4 |1 2 3 5   | 11|
|4 1 | 2 3 5 6  | 12|

Every player gets 4 rounds as their fanatic- everyone but player 1 gets them in 2 blocks. Every player gets to interact with 4 of the other players (leaving 1 player they never interact with). The average flock member can live up to 4 days. Given 10 minutes for a day and 3 minutes for "night time" transition/accounting, that puts the game at 156 minutes (2.5 hours) leaving plenty of time for further rounds.

Keeping everything IG during the day and keeping transitions brief (settle your faith debt, occasionally generate a new flock member, mentally prepping for day's event) should keep the game snappy and moving forward.

## Bonus Digital Content

Because Rebecca can't think of entirely pen & paper games. Digital content makes everything better. Sweet sweet semi-randomized content & digital stats tracking.


### Day Event Generation

A single person can come up with all events, but it'd be nice if part of the pre-game process people suggested ideas for what day events could be. They could also suggest event ideas that are relevant to their Deity and a delicious semi-randomized function could try to ensure that these events happen shortly before/during/shortly after a particular fanatic's run.

### Flock Generation

Obviously it can be left up to the players to come up with a handful of interesting flock members. It can also help if they're digitally assisted with a 1 sentance prompt on a possible driving motive. This would mean that when they're listening to the fanatics they're trying to get a specific answer/response/resolution from them. Which also means fanatics have to tailor their message to that day's flock. 

It would also help if any of that day's newly generated flock members had a prompt related to the day's event.

Randomized resource generation would also be a win. This could be done with just a dice roll but phffff! Things a flock member might have to distribute amongst the fanatics:

- money
- family members (to deticate as future fanatics or, you know, sacrifice)
- lands
- wordly goods- from jewels to cows. Incorporating a fun noun dictionary here could provide good comedic prompts to work from.

Every flock member will at least start with the same amount of "faith" that they can chose to deticate. This can be spread amongst several days and Deities or dumped in one go. It must be dumped entirely before that flock member is ended (either throught the day(s) or just as the character is ending, possibly "at night")

### Fanatics' Feats

It would be nice if the fanatic could spend the goods they have to impress the flocks or aid a flock member in resolving an issue. Faith would be spent on preforming religious feats of wonder (curing the blind, restoring the dead, water into wine, etc).

There should be a set of standard feats available to all at the same cost of faith. Part of pre-game Deity generation would perhaps be to design 1-3 specific feats for your Deity. These could be taken into account when generating flock character modivations/prompts.

In order to ensure fair play amongst all, especially those who start their fanatics later in the game, all flock members should start with the same amount of "awe" in regards to feats. Only flock characters that span several days could potentially become jaded to such things.

### Secrets

Covet everything, including information! While this does not enforce a digital system, if the tracking of faith/goods/upcoming fanatic player was secret things Would Probably Be Better. And making it digital would make tracking it secretly better.

The flock-to-fanatic conversion should be fair but not a fixed order. Perhaps done Pandemic style (each round is "fair" but internally randomized)
